# SaaS Chatbot Application

A MERN-stack chatbot platform with configurable conversation logic.

## Tech Stack
React.js • Node.js • Express.js • MongoDB

## Overview
- Dynamic chat-flow configuration (intents, responses, rules)
- REST APIs for message handling and configuration management
- MongoDB for storing messages and rule sets
- Focus on data-driven configuration rather than hardcoded logic

## Project Structure (simplified)
- /client — React frontend (ChatWindow, SettingsPanel)
- /server — Express APIs, models, controllers
- /docs — architecture diagram and screenshots

## How I measured improvements
- Optimized rendering and database queries; measured response times locally via Chrome DevTools and MongoDB profiler.
- Metrics described in resume are local-test based improvements.

## Notes
- This repository contains working skeleton code and documentation to explain configuration flows.
- No API keys or secrets are stored here.
